#Amber Skeleton `projects` directory

This is where you include `git submodule` references to your dependent
projects.

See [Working with submodules][3] for more information about using submodules.

**Note: it is not recommended to link the Amber project into this
directory. The Amber project is already linked into this project in the
`../server/projects/amber` directory.**
