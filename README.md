#Amber Project

Skeleton for Amber projects. The **server** directory is
intended to house a Pharo image. There's an install script that takes a
standard Pharo image and turns it into an Amber file server.

I'll probably use git submodules for Amber and the supporting code for
both Amber and the Pharo file server.

The idea is that you'd clone this project and then use it for each of
your own Amber projects.
